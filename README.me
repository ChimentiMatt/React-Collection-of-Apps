# GreenSock, a React Collection of Apps
###An App for exploratory coding with an emphasis on animations. 

###It has largely been used to teach me GreenSock Animations. I find it very fun and exciting. It is an app that shows my successes while hiding my failures. Those failures though have taught me a great deal and are great substance to learning more advanced fondant techniques.
